# 🏏 ODI Cricket Match Prediction – Web App

This is a **Flask-based web application** that enables real-time predictions during One Day Internationals (ODIs):

- **First Innings Final Score Prediction** using a TensorFlow Lite LSTM model.
- **Second Innings Chase Success Prediction** using a dense neural network in TFLite format.

---

## 🌐 Live Interface

The application allows users to enter match data, such as current runs, wickets, and overs. Upon submitting:

- First innings returns a **predicted final score**.
- Second innings returns a **chase win probability (%)**.

Team selection automatically displays national flags using a simple JS mapping.

---

## 🧠 First Innings: Final Score Prediction

> Predicts the final total runs of the first innings based on the current state.

### ✅ Features Used

- `curr_runs`: Runs at the current over
- `curr_wickets`: Wickets fallen so far
- `overs`: Overs completed

### ⚙️ Model: LSTM (TFLite version)

- Layers: LSTM(64) → LSTM(32) → Dropout → BatchNorm → Dense
- Converted to `.tflite` for deployment
- Input reshaped to `(1, 1, 3)` in real-time

## 🏃‍♂️ Second Innings: Chase Success Prediction

> Predicts the win probability for the team batting second.

### ✅ Features Used

- `target_runs`: Target set in first innings
- `curr_runs`: Current score of second innings
- `curr_wickets`: Wickets fallen
- `overs`: Overs completed

### ⚙️ Model: Dense Neural Network (TFLite version)

- Layers: Dense(32) → Dropout → Dense(16) → Dropout → Dense(8) → Sigmoid
- Binary classification (win/lose)
- Outputs probability between 0 and 1

## 📈 Model Evaluation

| Model                  | Accuracy / Score     |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| LSTM Final Score       | MAE ≈ 30 runs        |
| NN Win Probability     | Accuracy ≈ 82%       |

Models were trained using Cricsheet ball-by-ball data and manually scaled/cropped for performance in real-time prediction.

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Integrate real-time APIs (e.g., Cricbuzz, ESPNcricinfo)
- Show match timelines or momentum graphs
- Include venue, weather, and toss conditions
- Add batsman/bowler features (strike rate, match-up analysis)
- Extend to **T20/Tests** and build mobile-first version
